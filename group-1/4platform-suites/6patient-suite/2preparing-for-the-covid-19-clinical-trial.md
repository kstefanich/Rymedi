# Preparing for the Covid-19 Clinical Trial

- Prior to be tested for Covid-19, you will be required to fill out a brief questionnaire to collect critical data.

- After completing this process, you will be given a unique Patient QR code that you will need to bring to the testing site.

- There are 5 possible sections to the questionnaire:
    1. Agree to the terms and conditions.
    2. Enter your personal data (name, birthdate, etc.).
    3. Respond to the health questions, noting pre-existing conditions, medications, and potential exposure to Covid-19.
    4. Select any symptoms you may have experienced in the past or now.
    5. If applicable, enter your insurance data (Insurance Name, Number, etc.)

- Once completed, press the “Submit” button. You will now be taken to a page with your unique Patient QR code and ID. Choose “Download PDF” and either print this document or save this file to your smartphone. The person administering your Covid-19 test will need this image or the associated ID at the testing site.

- Thank you for your participation in the fight against Covid-19.
