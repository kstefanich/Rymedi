# Sub-Organizations

- Sub-Organization is a powerful feature that enables companies to offer a “whitelabel franchise” testing platform to their own customers based on the Rymedi 
  rapidtest Platform. Each Sub-Organization is self administered and has all the major modules including initiating tests, managing users and tracking the 
  health status of the users etc.

- Sub-Organizations are able to create their own User Accounts, Testing Groups and start their own Clinical trials.

- Example of use cases for Sub-Organizations:

    - As a Test Kit reseller you can easily setup a Sub-Organization for your different customers so they can start using your technology in their area.

    - If your company is providing testing services for other companies and institutions, you can use the rapidtest whitelabel, add Sub-Organizations to offer 
      each of your customers a dedicated testing environment under your own brand. 

    - If your company has a chain of stores you can create a Sub-Organization for each store.
