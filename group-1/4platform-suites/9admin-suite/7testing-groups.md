# Testing Groups

- Testing Groups are logical containers that can be created to track and manage a specific group of users. An organization may need only one or choose to 
  manage their clinical trials with many of these Testing Groups.

- When creating a new Testing Group, you will receive a unique URL. Send this URL to the Patients you want to test. After opening the link the Patient will 
  be sent to a dedicated registration web page where they can register their patient information and health status. After completing the questionnaire the 
  patient will receive their personal Patient QR-Code. This Patient QR-Code will be required during the Covid-19 testing process.

- The patients test result will be grouped according to the Testing Group they have registered with. For example, if Patient A received a link to the Testing 
  Group “Cohort 1”, Patient A’s test result will be added to Cohort 1 Group. If you send Patient B a new link for Testing Group “Cohort 2”, Patient B’s test 
  result will be added to Cohort 2. Thereby the organization can track the spread of Covid-19 infection and diseases by the Testing Groups they have chosen.

{% hint style="info" %} Note: Currently patients cannot be moved between Testing Groups. If you retest a patient as part of a different group or clinical 
trial, their test results will be added to their original testing group that they registered with.  {% endhint %}

- Examples of Testing Groups: Companies, departments, schools and universities classes, public institutions, employees, medical personnel from a hospital, 
  airline passengers, the different neighborhoods of a city, etc...
