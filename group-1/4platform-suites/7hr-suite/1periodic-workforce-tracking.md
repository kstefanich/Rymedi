# Periodic Workforce Tracking

- Rapidtest HR Suite enables your company to test your employees and control the spread of the Covid19 infection. Employees can periodically update their 
  health status through the platform. They have their own accounts where they can find their personal testing history and test results. HR managers can easily 
  check the health status of the company and ensure its safety by recommending best prevention practices to their employees.

- **HR Manager Suite Features**

    - **Dashboard**: Here you have a general overview of the inspection stats: The number of employees that have symptoms, number of viral tests administered 
      per week, number of positive tests, number of Antibody Tests administered that day and how many employees have tested positive.

    - **Employees List**: You can arrange your employee list by different health attributes. This page provides the HR Manager an overview over the current 
      health status of the workforce, including test results and health scores.
      
      | **Last Reported Symptoms** | **Last Test** | **Test Result** | **Last Health Score** |
      | ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
      | The last time when the user reported their symptoms via the app. | The last time a user completed a test. | The Test Result of the most recent test. | The current health score based on the reported symptoms. |

- **Setting Up Periodic WorkForce Tracking**

    1. The organization admin adds HR Manager accounts.
    2. The organization HR Manager will send employees an invitation via email.
    3. The invited users will follow the link in the email to complete the registration process.
    4. Users are now able to login with the account credentials they provided during registration.
    5. Users are periodically tested and can enter updates about their health status into the platform. 
    6. The HR Manager can monitor the health status of the employees and ensures the safety of the company.

{% hint style="info" %} If you have invited your employees via the Testing Group feature, the users will not be displayed in the HR Suite. You need to send them 
an invitation email instead (see step 2). Users registered via Testing Groups are Patients and cannot report their Health Status regularly in the HR Suite. {% endhint %}
