# Product Technology Types: Antibody Tests

- Antibody tests detect the presence of antibodies in the patientâ€™s blood. Antibodies are produced by the immune system when somebody has been infected. The test 
  will involve obtaining a drop of blood via finger prick, or with a lancet. The blood sample will be applied to a test cassette, which will return a result that 
  is visually interpreted.

- A positive antibody test tells you that the patient is infected with Covid-19 or has been infected in the past. 

- Negative results do not rule out Covid-19 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. The incubation of Covid-19 takes between 2 
  and 14 days. Antibody testing in the early days of the infection may result negative because a low level of immunological response.

- Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic test should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals.
