# Product Labels and Test Kit Results

**Products Labels and Test Kit Results**: When we assign a specific testing technology to a new product (1) we are defining how the test kit will be completed. That 
is how the Test Kit result fields will look like. Check Product Technologies and Interpreting Results slides for more information.

{% hint style="info" %} Notice that the technology that you choose will also define what test result template will be used, the Email templates sent to the patients and the kind of 
notifications workflows that your patients will receive. {% endhint %}
