# Assigning Products to Organizations

- The main organization can create products for their sub-organizations.

- When you are creating a product tap the Organization field (1) and select the organization  (2) which you want to link that product.

- Select **Global** (3) to enable this product to all your sub-organizations. They will be able to use this product for labelling and assign it to their own 
  Testing Groups.
