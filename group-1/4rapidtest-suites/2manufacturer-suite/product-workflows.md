# Product Workflows

Rapidtest QR code labels helps organizations to have a correct use of their test kits, avoids fraud, the misinterpretation of the results or mixing patient 
results between different testing groups or organizations. Each product label will have specific tracking properties. Let's check them!

Products Labels and Organizations: Products follows a hierarchical logic. When an organization creates a product it can only be used within its organization and 
its sub organizations. Products labelled by different organizations wonâ€™t be accepted. Main organization Test Kits will work among their sub organizations but 
the products labelled by sub organizations will only work inside their own organization and not between the other sub organizations.

from another organization! {% endhint %}
