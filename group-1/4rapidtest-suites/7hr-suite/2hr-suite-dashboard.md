# HR Suite Dashboard

- rapidtest HR Dashboard is a powerful tool that enables you to quickly visualize the generated testing data and check your employees health score. Easily 
  monitor the health status of your company and warn your employees if something goes wrong.

- In the **HR Suite Dashboard** you can check:
	
    - The Symptom Tracker: The number of employees that have symptoms that day and total number of symptoms logged to date. The counter is reset every day.

    - The Viral Tests: The number of Viral Tests that have been administered and how many positive results have been found in the current week, as well as total 
      number of Viral Tests administered to date. Counter resets at the end of the week.
      
      {% hint style="info" %} Please notice that getting results from Viral Tests or PCR Tests takes longer than the Antibody Tests. This is why they are only 
      displayed weekly. The Antiviral Test Chart is updated every 7 days at UTC 0. {% endhint %}
      
    - Antibody Tests: The number of Antibody Tests that have been administered and how many positive results have been found that day as well as total number of 
      Antibody Tests administered to date. The counter resets at the end of the day.
