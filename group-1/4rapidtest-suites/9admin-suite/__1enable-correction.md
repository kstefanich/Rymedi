# Enable Correction

- It could happen that a Laboratory physician enters a wrong test kit result by mistake.

- Enable Correction feature gives admins the opportunity to change the Test Kit status in order that HCP can correct the mistake.

- The process flow to correct a Test Kit result data is as follows:

    1. The admin flags the Test Kit with the status Correction and adds a message explaining the purpose for such correction.
    2. Now the HCP can scan the Test Kit again and add the correction.

{% hint style="info" %} The time frame for Test Kits Result to be corrected is limited to 12 hours. If a Test Kit result is older than 12h the result cannot be corrected anymore! {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} When the admin switches the status to Correction that status is valid for a 12 hours period. It will be switched back to the previous status if the HCP doesnâ€™t make corrections during this frame of time. If that happens the timing for admins to change the Test Kit status is reseted for 12 more hours. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} All these updates are registered in the blockchain. {% endhint %}
